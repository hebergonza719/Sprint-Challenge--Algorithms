#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Since there is one loop, it is O(n). 


b) This pseudocode contains a nested loop. We need to multiply O(n) * O(n) which results in O(n^2).


c) This is a recursive call. It resembles a loop. I think it is O(n) because it will eventually reach the base case.
